    <h1>About LiveAtlas</h1>

    <p>
      LiveAtlas was born from a simple idea:
      people should be able to experience the world even when they cannot be there physically.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform explores live presence, guided experiences,
      and human connection through technology — without replacing reality.
    </p>
